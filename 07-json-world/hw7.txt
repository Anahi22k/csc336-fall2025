JSON Structure Requirements

Your top-level object must have a key called "regions" whose value is an array.
Each region must be an object containing:
"name" – the name of the region
"climate" – a string (e.g. "temperate", "arid")
"towns" – an array of town objects
    Each town must include:
    "name" – the town’s name
    "population" – a number
    "notable_people" – an array of people
        Each person must include:
        "name" – their full name
        "role" – their occupation or title
        "items" – an array of objects or strings representing their possessions
At least one item must be an object with its own properties (for example: an item that has both a "name" and "rarity").
Your data should be at least 3 levels deep (e.g., region → town → person → item).

region -> obj that contains:
    name, climate, towns
        town:
            array of town objects
            name
            population
            notable people - array
            each array:
                name
                role
